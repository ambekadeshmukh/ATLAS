ATLAS: Automated Threat Learning and Analysis System

A comprehensive DevOps project integrating Wazuh, cloud-native tools, and machine learning for advanced security monitoring and automated incident response.

In today's rapidly evolving threat landscape, organizations must proactively monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents to protect their critical assets and maintain business continuity.

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a cloud-based security monitoring and data analysis platform that leverages the open-source Wazuh security tool and other cloud-native technologies. By centralizing and analyzing security-related logs and events, the platform will provide valuable insights into the organization's security posture, enabling data-driven decision-making and automated incident response.

# **Project Objectives:**

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Setup**: Establish a secure and scalable cloud infrastructure to host the security monitoring and data analysis components.
2. **Wazuh Security Monitoring**: Implement Wazuh, an open-source security platform, to collect, analyze, and store security-related logs and events.
3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Develop data pipelines and analytical tools to extract insights from the security data, enabling a deeper understanding of security trends, patterns, and potential threats.
4. **Automated Alarm Management**: Leverage machine learning techniques to create a system that can automatically suggest and potentially apply appropriate solutions for detected security alarms, reducing the manual effort required for incident response.
5. **Documentation and Presentation**: Thoroughly document the project's architecture, implementation details, and the insights gained from the data analysis. Prepare a comprehensive presentation to showcase the project's outcomes and its potential impact on the organization's security posture.

# **Expected Outcomes:**

Upon the successful completion of this project, any given organization will benefit from the following:

1. Improved security monitoring and event detection capabilities through the integration of the Wazuh platform.
2. Enhanced visibility and understanding of the organization's security landscape through comprehensive data analysis and visualization.
3. Streamlined incident response processes through the implementation of an automated alarm management system, reducing the time and effort required to address security incidents.
4. Increased security awareness and informed decision-making based on the insights gained from the project.
5. A reusable and scalable cloud-based security monitoring and data analysis platform that can be further expanded and optimized over time.
